  The time has come, the Walrus said,
      To talk of many things:
Of shoes - and ships — and sealing-wax —
      Of cabbages - and kings -
And why the sea is boiling hot -
      And whether pigs have wings.'

The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright -
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.
